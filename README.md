# Housing-Price-Regression-NN

# 🏠 Housing Price Regression with Neural Networks

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on structured/tabular data, including features such as number of rooms, area, location, and more.

The goal is to evaluate how well a deep learning model performs on relatively small, structured datasets.
